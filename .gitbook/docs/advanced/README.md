# Advanced Usage

While understanding the basics provides a solid foundation, the true potential of result objects is unlocked through
their functional capabilities. Mastering these techniques enables concise and readable error handling by leveraging the
power of [monadic composition][MONAD].

The most idiomatic approach to handling results involves screening them and applying various mapping and flat-mapping
methods to transform and compose behavior.
