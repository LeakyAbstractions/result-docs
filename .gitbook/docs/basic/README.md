# Basic Usage

In this section, we'll cover foundational use cases, including checking the status of a result, unwrapping the value
inside a result, and taking different actions based on success or failure.

![No need for if blocks or early return statements when you can handle success and failure without any hassle.][BASIC_USAGE]

These basics will help you handle errors more cleanly and efficiently without cluttering your code with *try-catch*
blocks.
