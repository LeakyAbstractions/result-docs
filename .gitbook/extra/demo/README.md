description: Check out some REST APIs that consume and produce Result objects
---

# Demo Projects

To help you become familiar with this library, you can explore two demo projects that showcase how to handle and
serialize `Result` objects within popular frameworks like [Spring Boot][SPRING_BOOT] and [Micronaut][MICRONAUT]. Each
project provides a working example of a "pet store" web service that exposes a REST API for managing pets. They are
based on [Swagger Petstore Sample][SWAGGER_PETSTORE] and you can interact with them using [Swagger-UI][SWAGGER_UI].

{% hint style="info" %}

- [**Spring Boot**][SPRING_BOOT] is a widely-used, JVM-based framework designed to simplify the development of
  stand-alone, production-ready [Spring](https://spring.io/) applications. It emphasizes convention over configuration,
  allowing developers to get started quickly with minimal setup. Known for its extensive ecosystem and robust community
  support, Spring Boot streamlines the creation of microservices and enterprise applications, leveraging the powerful
  Spring Framework while minimizing boilerplate code.
- [**Micronaut**][MICRONAUT] is a modern, JVM-based framework for building lightweight microservices and serverless
  applications. It focuses on fast startup times and low memory usage. Although not as widely adopted as
  [Spring Boot][SPRING_BOOT], it has gained popularity for its performance and innovative features.

These projects illustrate how to develop powerful APIs using Result objects. Follow the examples to create resilient web
services that elegantly handle success and failure scenarios.
