# Recap

> ***Level up and lessons learned***

Congratulations on reaching the end of this guide! By now, you should have a solid understanding of how to use results in your Java applications effectively. Here's a brief recap of what you've learned:

- **Getting Started:** You learned how to integrate result objects into your codebase and instantiate new ones.
- **Basic Usage:** You explored foundational operations like checking statuses, unwrapping values, and executing conditional actions based on result status, enabling you to respond dynamically to success and failure scenarios.
- **Advanced Usage:** You delved into more sophisticated techniques like screening results to transform successes and failures based on conditions, and leveraging mapping and flat-mapping methods to compose behaviors in a functional style.

For more details on the Result API, you can read the [Javadoc reference documentation](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.leakyabstractions/result-api/).
