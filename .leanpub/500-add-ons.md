# Add-Ons

> ***Boosting results with enhanced capabilities***

Add-ons are optional, yet powerful extensions to the Result library, designed to provide extra features that can be integrated on demand.

These small, focused libraries provide a modular approach to extending the core functionalities of Results without adding unnecessary complexity.

- **Lazy results** allow us to defer expensive calculations until absolutely necessary.
- **Fluent assertions for Result** allow us to write expressive tests using AssertJ.
- **The Jackson datatype module for Result** allows us to serialize and deserialize results using Jackson.
- **The Micronaut serialization support for Result** allows us to serialize and deserialize results using Micronaut.
