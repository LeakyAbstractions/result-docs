`Result` objects represent the outcome of an operation, removing the need to check for null. Operations that succeed produce results encapsulating a *success* value; operations that fail produce results with a *failure* value. Success and failure can be represented by whatever types make the most sense for each operation.

## Results in a Nutshell

In Java, methods that can fail typically do so by throwing exceptions. Then, exception-throwing methods are called from inside a `try` block to handle errors in a separate `catch` block.

This approach is lengthy, and that's not the only problem â€” it's also very slow.

Conventional wisdom says **exceptional logic shouldn't be used for normal program flow**. Results make us deal with expected error situations explicitly to enforce good practices and make our programs [run faster](#benchmarks).

Let's now look at how the above code could be refactored if `connect()` returned a `Result` object instead of throwing an exception.

In the example above, we used only 4 lines of code to replace the 10 that worked for the first one. But we can effortlessly make it shorter by chaining methods. In fact, since we were returning `-1` just to signal that the underlying operation failed, we are better off returning a `Result` object upstream. This will allow us to compose operations on top of `getServerUptime()` just like we did with `connect()`.

![Embracing Results](embracing-results.png)

`Result` objects are immutable, providing thread safety without the need for synchronization. This makes them ideal for multi-threaded applications, ensuring predictability and eliminating side effects.
