> ***Check out some REST APIs that consume and produce Result objects***

To help you become familiar with this library, you can explore two demo projects that showcase how to handle and serialize `Result` objects within popular frameworks like [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) and [Micronaut](https://micronaut.io/). Each project provides a working example of a "pet store" web service that exposes a REST API for managing pets. They are based on [Swagger Petstore Sample](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-petstore) and you can interact with them using [Swagger-UI](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui).

- **Spring Boot** is a widely-used, JVM-based framework designed to simplify the development of stand-alone, production-ready [Spring](https://spring.io/) applications. It emphasizes convention over configuration, allowing developers to get started quickly with minimal setup. Known for its extensive ecosystem and robust community support, Spring Boot streamlines the creation of microservices and enterprise applications, leveraging the powerful Spring Framework while minimizing boilerplate code.
- **Micronaut** is a modern, JVM-based framework for building lightweight microservices and serverless applications. It focuses on fast startup times and low memory usage. Although not as widely adopted as Spring Boot, it has gained popularity for its performance and innovative features.
